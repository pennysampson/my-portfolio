# My Portfolio
I just want to start building a website that represents myself, like an online CV with my projects (once I have some).

## Goals
My aim is to use this to practice my html and css skills, and hopefully over time this can evolve into a great portfolio web page.
I want my web page to have a crisp and clear look with usability in mind, and for it to dynamically adjust for different devices.
I would like to also add a dark mode.
I would also really like to investigate accessability options and solutions, eg enlarge text, colour blindness, adding audio description?
